# 📄 Task Description  

👉 One PDF guides will be provided:
- [First_years_Task Pdf](Task4/First_years_Machine_Learning.pdf) → Contains questions regarding Linear and Logistic Regression.

For this task, you will practice implementing Machine Learning algorithms from scratch using **NumPy**,
loading and preprocessing data using **Pandas**, and visualizing results using **Matplotlib**.

There is **no separate report** for this task.  

You are required to complete two sub-tasks — **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression**.

---

## 🧠 Task 1: Linear Regression  

### 🎯 Objective  

Predict **Average Student Score** using Linear Regression.

You are given a dataset **student_perfomance.csv** that contains information about students’ demographics, study habits, and exam
results.

Your goal is to build a Linear Regression model from scratch that predicts the **Average Student Score** based on multiple input features.

---

## 🧠 Task 2: Logistic Regression  

### 🎯 Objective  

Predict whether a person earns >50k or <=50k using Logistic Regression.

You are given a dataset **adult.csv** contains census data including age, education, occupation, and other socioeconomic indicators.
Your task is to build a Logistic Regression model from scratch to predict whether a person earns >50k or <=50k annually.
