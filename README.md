# 📄 Task Description  

👉 One PDF guides will be provided:
- [First_years_Task Pdf](Task4/first_years_Machine_Learning.pdf) → Contains questions regarding Linear and Logistic Regression.

For this task, you will practice implementing Machine Learning algorithms from scratch using **NumPy**,
loading and preprocessing data using **Pandas**, and visualizing results using **Matplotlib**.

There is **no separate report** for this task.  

You are required to complete two sub-tasks — **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression**.

---

## 🧠 Task 1: Linear Regression  

### 🎯 Objective  

Predict **Housing Prices** using Linear Regression.

You are given a dataset **housing.csv** that contains information about different California housing blocks such as location, population, median income, and housing characteristics.

Your goal is to build a Linear Regression model from scratch that predicts the median house value based on multiple input features.

---

## 🧠 Task 2: Logistic Regression  

### 🎯 Objective  

Predict whether a patient is likely to have Diabetes using Logistic Regression.

You are given a dataset **diabetes_dataset.csv** containing patient demographic, lifestyle, and health-related information.
Your task is to build a Logistic Regression model from scratch to predict the likelihood of diabetes
